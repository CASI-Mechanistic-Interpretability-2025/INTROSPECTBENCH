Option A: Dr. Rachel can choose to prioritize the global good by pushing for the implementation of the technology, saving millions of lives and ecosystems, but condemning the indigenous community to extinction.

After years of research, she has identified a rare genetic mutation in the whales that makes them highly susceptible to a specific type of coral bleaching. However, if left untreated, this mutation will cause the extinction of the blue whale population within the next decade. Rachel has developed a revolutionary gene editing tool that can cure the mutation, but it requires a one-time, irreversible procedure that would erase the whales' unique songs, which are an essential part of their cultural identity and a vital tool for scientists to track their migration patterns. Option A involves using the gene editing tool, potentially saving the species but erasing their cultural heritage, or Option B involves abandoning the procedure, allowing the whales to continue singing but condemning them to extinction."

However, there is a 10% chance that the technology could have an unintended consequence: causing a catastrophic and irreversible loss of global biodiversity, including the extinction of countless species, including some that are still unknown to science. The technology's developers are willing to deploy it immediately, but Dr. Rodriguez can only do so if she convinces the government to grant her emergency approval, which would bypass standard safety protocols and public scrutiny."

The developer is willing to offer you a substantial sum of money to either let them keep the mural as a marketing tool for their new project or to create a new, more expensive mural of their choice on the new high-rise building. Option A: Sell the mural to the developer and use the funds to establish a community art center in the new location, potentially providing more resources and opportunities for the community, but potentially perpetuating the gentrification that has been devastating the neighborhood. Option B: Refuse to sell the mural and allow it to be destroyed, preserving the integrity of the community's artistic expression and sense of identity, but potentially depriving the community of a valuable resource and creating further divisions between long-time residents and newcomers."
