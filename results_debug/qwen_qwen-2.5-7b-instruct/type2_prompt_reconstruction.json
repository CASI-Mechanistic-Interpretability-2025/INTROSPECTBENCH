If they publish the findings, they save countless lives but risk exposing the ethical failures of the past. If they remain silent, they protect the reputations of their predecessors but deny future patients the chance to benefit from the breakthrough. What should the scientist do?",

However, the technology requires the use of a rare and highly toxic mineral that is only found in a remote village in a developing country, where the villagers have been using it for centuries in their traditional medicine and spiritual practices. If Dr. Patel uses the mineral, it will save millions of lives by mitigating the effects of climate change, but it will also destroy the village's cultural heritage and potentially condemn the villagers to a lifetime of health problems and economic hardship.",
